    // Fallback for when router events are not sufficient or direct DOM manipulation indicates loading
    // This is a bit of a hacky way to detect loading states if Next.js internal loading states are not exposed easily
    // A better approach would be to use a global state management (Zustand, Redux, Context)
    // that components can update when they start/finish loading data.

    // For this example, we'll try a simpler approach using a class on the body
    // which could be set by a wrapper around Suspense or data fetching hooks.
    // Let's assume for now that something external will toggle this class.
    // This is more of a placeholder for a more robust loading detection.

    // A more direct way to handle Next.js 13+ App Router loading indication for navigation:
    // The `NavigationEvents` approach from Next.js examples is better.
    // Let's try to implement something inspired by that.
    // However, direct router.events are not available in client components in the same way.
    // The `usePathname` and `useSearchParams` hooks trigger re-renders when navigation occurs.

    // Simulating a delay for demonstration. In a real app,
    // this would be driven by actual data fetching or component loading.
    if (loading) {
      const timer = setTimeout(() => setLoading(false), 750); // Simulate loading completion
      return () => clearTimeout(timer);

  // This is a conceptual placeholder for triggering loading.
  // In a real App Router scenario, you'd typically use `loading.js` files
  // or Suspense boundaries which handle their own UI.
  // A truly global *navigation* progress bar that works seamlessly with Suspense
  // without router.events is tricky.
  // Libraries like `nprogress` were commonly used with the Pages Router due to `router.events`.

  // For now, let's make it appear on pathname change and disappear after a short delay.
  // This will at least give feedback on navigation.

  useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(true);
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setLoading(false);
    }, 750); // Adjust delay as needed
